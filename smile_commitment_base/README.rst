Account Budget Commitment
=========================

Since Odoo 9.0, it's not possible anymore to set a general account on analytic lines.

This module adds a commitment account on analytic line.

A new commitment type is defined on analytic line: purchase, sale or payroll.

This module enables commitment budget limit by user:

- global limit
- limit by budgetary position


Usage
=====

You can set commitment budget limits on users' form, on `Commitments` page.

To follow purchase commitment, please install
`smile_commitment_purchase <https://github.com/Smile-SA/odoo_addons/tree/11.0/smile_commitment_purchase>`_
.
